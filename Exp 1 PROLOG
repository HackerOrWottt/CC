What is Prolog?
Prolog (short for Programming in Logic) is a high-level programming language 
rooted in formal logic, primarily used for solving problems that involve complex 
relationships and symbolic reasoning. Developed in the 1970s, it is particularly well-
suited for tasks in artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing, expert 
systems, and problem-solving applications.
Features of Prolog:
1. Declarative Nature: Prolog is a declarative language, meaning you define 
what the problem is rather than detailing how to solve it. The program is 
essentially a set of facts and rules about the problem domain.
2. Facts and Rules: Prolog programs are written as facts (basic statements about 
data) and rules (logical statements that define relationships). For example: ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
3. Queries: You can ask questions (queries) based on the facts and rules you've 
defined. Prolog will attempt to find solutions based on logical inferences.
 ?- ancestor(john, mary).
4. Backtracking: Prolog uses a backtracking mechanism to find solutions by 
trying multiple possibilities and backtracking to find alternative solutions if 
necessary.
Applications of Prolog:
1. Natural Language Processing: 
Prolog can be used to parse and understand human languages by defining 
grammatical rules and structures.
2. Expert Systems: 
Prolog is effective in building systems that mimic human experts by applying 
logical rules to infer conclusions from a set of knowledge.
3. Knowledge Representation:
